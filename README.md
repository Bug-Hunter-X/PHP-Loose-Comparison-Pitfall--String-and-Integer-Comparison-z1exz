This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in PHP related to loose comparisons between strings and integers.  The `bug.php` file contains code that exhibits the problem. The `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version using strict comparison (`$a === $b`).  Loose comparison (`==`) can lead to unexpected behavior due to PHP's type juggling.  Always prefer strict comparison (`===`) for reliable results when comparing values of different types.

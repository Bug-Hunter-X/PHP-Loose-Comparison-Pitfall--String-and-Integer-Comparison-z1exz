This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling.  The comparison `$a == $b` uses loose comparison, meaning PHP will attempt to convert the operands to a common type before comparing.  If `$a` is a string and `$b` is an integer, PHP might convert the string to an integer, leading to unexpected results. For example, if `$a = "10abc"` and `$b = 10`, the comparison will evaluate to true because PHP converts "10abc" to 10 before comparing.
